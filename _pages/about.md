<b>On a hunt for full-time machine learning and software engineering roles for <u>January 2024</u>, where I can contribute intellectually to solve challenging problems :) !!!</b>

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I am Soham (so-hum). Pleased to meet you! 

I am a graduate student at the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), Carnegie Mellon University. 

My research interests lie in Large Language Models, Multimodal Machine Learning, Audio-based interactions, and Natural Language Processing. My research has been presented at conferences like ACL,  ISLS, APSIPA, and NeurIPS. 

My efforts at CMU have been focused on various aspects of interactive intelligence. Be it my current capstone, where I am working towards an on-device multimodal,  virtual teaching assistant, or the courses I took like Artificial Social Intelligence, where I actively participated in discussions on realizing social intelligence in AI. 

On the other hand, I am also working towards enhancing my breadth by taking courses like Deep Reinforcement Learning and learning about Large Language Models (LLMs). 

My internship project at ï£¿ Apple was an effort to investigate how to run LLMs on a device. I built a Jax-based online-model distillation framework for distilling LLMs on distributed GPUs and identified limitations of the popular  [TinyBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10351) distillation algorithm for decoder-style LLMs.

I have also worked with [Prof Chng Eng Siong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng/default.html) from NTU Singapore, on improving speech and audio representations and using a curriculum-learning based approach to enhance model convergence.

My current aim is to maximize my learning, enhance my depth and breadth and use the knowledge to research and develop applications that deliver pleasant end-user experiences.

My drive to keep on learning and appreciation of the importance of teamwork and collaborative progress will help me achieve my goal of creating meaningful technology that makes everyone's lives better :sunny:.
