<b>On a hunt for full-time machine learning and software engineering roles for <u>January 2024</u>, where I can contribute intellectually to solve challenging problems :) !!!</b>

üëã Hey there! I‚Äôm Soham (so-hum). Pleased to meet you!

I‚Äôm a Data Scientist at AppZen, where I work on expense auditing by leveraging transformers and LLMs to improve document categorization. Recently, I delivered a fraud detection model that combines Na√Øve Bayes, Probability Theory, and Llama-3.1 to identify fraudulent submissions in automated expense platforms.

I earned my Master‚Äôs from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2022, specializing in Language Technologies. My research interests include:

LLM distillation & fine-tuning
Multimodal Machine Learning
LLM-based audio interactions
Natural Language Processing
Reinforcement Learning
Artificial Social Intelligence (My dream is to build an agent as socially intelligent as humans!)


## Research & Experience
I have presented my [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oVO9OCsAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) at ACL, ISLS, APSIPA, and NeurIPS. My work at CMU focused on interactive intelligence, where I developed an on-device multimodal virtual teaching assistant under the guidance of [Prof Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/).

During my internship at Apple Ô£ø, I explored on-device LLMs, building a Jax-based online distillation framework for distributed GPUs and evaluating the TinyBERT distillation algorithm for decoder-based models.

I also collaborated with [Prof Chng Eng Siong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng/default.html) at NTU Singapore on speech and audio representations, using a curriculum-learning approach to improve model convergence.

## Looking Ahead
My goal is to maximize my learning, deepen my expertise, and develop applications that enhance user experiences. I believe in the power of collaboration and meaningful technology to make everyday life better ‚òÄÔ∏è.
